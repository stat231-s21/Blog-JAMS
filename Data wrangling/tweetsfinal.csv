@DjSunstone Limitations on/cost of fresh water supply might be a concern with an urban farm in the long term. Access to clean water should be the first consideration. Soil can be built up/amended to fertility (as the Israelis have shown) but w/o water nothing happens anywhere.
"""When it comes to the issue of freshwater management, many factors come into play, including climate change, access to drinking water in Indigenous community and flood policies.

All of these issues contribute to the need to create a Canada Water Agency.""
